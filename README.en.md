## 🎮 The Game

**Impostor Game** is a multiplayer experience inspired by viral social media deduction games, "Among Us," and "Taboo."

### How does it work?
1. Each player receives a **secret word** except for the **Impostor**.
2. **The Impostor:** One or more players who don't know the group's word and must try to guess it by following the rhythm of the round.
3. **Non-Impostors:** Players who receive the word and must provide clues/words related to the theme without revealing the actual word.
4. **The Challenge:** Using subtle clues, players must identify who the impostor is.
5. **The Goal:** The **Impostor** must go unnoticed and deduce the round's word, while the non-impostors must find and vote to eject them.

**Fast, social, and designed to be played with friends on any device.**

## 🎥 Additional Feature: Streamer Overlay

A dedicated **Overlay** for broadcasts. Use it as a template for your streams so your audience can follow the game's pace with a professional interface.

### How to use it:
1. Create a game and enable the "Overlay for Broadcasts" option in the settings.
2. In OBS (or your preferred streaming software), add a **Browser Source** pointing to the application URL.
3. Configure the parameters to fit your broadcast layout needs.
4. Use the "Interact" feature on the source to join as a spectator/player.
